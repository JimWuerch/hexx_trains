# HeXX Trains

18XX Flutter App for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and the web.

This is a port of my C#/Xamarin Forms 18xx application.  It uses skia for graphics and renders all the tiles on the fly.  Tiles can be created in Tile Designer (http://www.rails18xx.it/index.html) and loaded by the application.
