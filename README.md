# HeXX Trains

18XX Flutter App

This is a port of my C#/Xamarin Forms 18xx application.  It uses skia for graphics and renders all the tiles on the fly.  Tiles can be created in Tile Designer (http://www.rails18xx.it/index.html) and loaded by the application.

## Getting Started

Note: To run this on a chrome device, use --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_USE_SKIA=true

If you aren't using VSCode, please set your line size to 120 for dartfmt.  80 is stupid and archaic.
